        <h1 class="main-header">Solution</h1>
        <p class="body-text">Blink Bikes aims to provide a luxurious yet functional cycling experience to high-earning clients. The goal is to offer an exclusive e-commerce platform that provides a seamless shopping experience. The website is designed to cater to the needs of its target audience, 24-38 year old high income earners. with a user-friendly interface that promotes intuitive navigation, secure and quick payment options, exclusive discounts, and the ability to compare and contrast products. These features ensure that customers can acquire a bike that caters to their specific needs with ease and security.</p>
        
        <h1 class="main-header">01 - Discovery</h1>
          <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">What are competitors doing?</h2>
          <p class="body-text">I started by researching three existing platforms that serve a similar purpose and performed a heuristic analysis compiling a list of likes, dislikes, and actionable items for each, then creating a list of 5 overall actionable items to implement into the design and research of Blink Bikes. </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Information availability:</strong> Increase the amount of detailed product information available on the website to help users make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Ease of access and navigation:</strong> Review and reorganize the information architecture of the website to make it clearer and more intuitive for users.</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Ideate - Test - Validate:</strong> Conduct user testing and gather feedback to identify other areas of improvement for the cart to checkout user flow.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Maintenance and upkeep:</strong> Implement changes based on user feedback to improve the overall user experience and monitor the website's performance to ensure a smooth and efficient user flow</p>
            </li>

            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Website load and efficiency:</strong> Optimize the website's loading times to reduce wait time for users and bounce rates.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
    
        <p class="body-text">Amazon's checkout process is often cited as a gold standard in e-commerce, thanks to its simple and straightforward layout that makes it easy for users to navigate and understand. The flow is flexible and convenient, allowing users to perform any action, such as editing their cart or viewing their order summary, from any screen. The user flow is designed with minimal clutter and distraction, with each step clearly labeled and easy to complete, resulting in a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.</p>
        <p class="body-text">TrekBikes has a visually pleasing UI with a modern aesthetic that showcases their products well. However, the cart-to-checkout process is confusing and frustrating due to its poorly structured information architecture, lack of clear guidance, and poor organization. This makes it difficult for users to understand where and when to click on individual elements. In contrast, Target's cart-to-checkout user flow is user-friendly, straightforward, and efficient, with a simple UI that guides the user effectively, similar to Amazon's user flow.</p>

The intended test demographic was originally meant to be conducted on users between the ages of 24 - 38, majority men, high-income earners. Unfortunately, I didn’t and still don’t have immediate access to anyone who fits this criteria. I, instead, tested close friends of family, some of whom are actively in the bicycle market and some not. Regardless, these tests provided valuable insight into the overall usability and intuitiveness of the platform.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The goal was to determine product quality and seamlessness of the experience to promote adoption and repeat usage. The test objectives were to uncover usability and other technical issues within the red routes of the product. Two key questions to answer were: Is our prototype seamless and how do users navigate our product? The test tasks were as follows:</p>

          <p class="body-text">I designed Blink Bikes to feel active, simplistic and intuitive to use. Simplicity is its central asset. It maintains a strong screen presence by guiding the users’ eyes directly to the information hotspots while simultaneously controlling the flow of information on the page. Users meet little to no resistance at every point of interaction and can efficiently use the information available to make an informed decision on what bike will suit their needs best. </p>

              In conclusion, my case study on Blink Bikes e-commerce website design highlights the significance of an iterative and user-centered approach in creating a successful user experience. By conducting thorough user research, including surveys, user interviews, and usability testing, we gain valuable insights into the needs and pain points of our target audience: high-income earners looking to purchase premium bikes. These insights inform the design decisions and help create a visually appealing and intuitive website that meets user needs while aligning with business goals.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li class="case-list-item mt-32">
              <p class="body-text">
              The use of interactive wireframes and prototypes facilitates stakeholder buy-in and ensures that design decisions are made in a collaborative environment. Iterative design allows for feedback from users, leading to improvements in the user experience, such as optimizing the checkout process and integrating a comprehensive bike comparison tool.

              <li class="case-list-item mt-32">
              <p class="body-text">
                Furthermore, the website's design emphasizes the use of high-quality visuals and clear product information, conveying the quality of the bikes and creating an aspirational feel that resonates with the target audience. The use of persuasive design techniques, such as social proof and scarcity, helps encourage conversions and drive sales.

                <li class="case-list-item mt-32">
                <p class="body-text">
                  In summary, the Blink Bikes e-commerce website design project results in a visually appealing, user-friendly, and effective platform that successfully meets business goals and user needs.
