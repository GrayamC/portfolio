        <p class="body-text">To help young adults who struggle to keep track of their budget better manage their money. </p>

        <h1 class="main-header">Solution</h1>
        <p class="body-text">With young adults, age 16-29 as the primary audience, the goal was to design a mobile-first app that focused on their primary concern — budgeting. With a user-friendly interface that promotes quick interaction, relevant and actionable notifications, and bite size educational tips, MIA will help users build confidence while holding themselves accountable for their personal finances. </p>

        <div class="subheader-area">
          <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">What are competitors doing?</h2>
          <p class="body-text">I started by researching three existing apps that target young adults and performed a heuristic analysis rating them 1-5 against four criteria, with 5 being the highest.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Match between system and real world:</strong> Does the product help the user with their most fundamental problem — budgeting in real life?</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>User control and freedom:</strong> Does the product enable enough flexibility for the user to feel like it’s custom-made for them?</p>

              <p class="body-text"><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</strong> Does the product actively demonstrate the simplicity it desires for the user?</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text">All three featured colorways that were minimalist and aesthetically uncluttered, but each struggled with usability with regard to content and signup. YNAB’s language most focused on budgeting, but it was a surprisingly lackluster and frustratingly unrefined tool for managing real-world finances. Pocketguard succeeds in simplicity but falls short in usability and freedom since it often feels cluttered and hard to navigate. Mint succeeded in creating an easy to use budgeting tool. While they fall short in some aspects of user control at signup and transparency with a beginner audience, especially when delving into deeper financial topics; they make up for it with a sleek design that is user friendly and easy to navigate.</p>

Of course, any effective interface has to feel <strong>effortless</strong> to use.

The goal was to determine product quality and seamlessness of the experience to promote adoption and repeat usage. The test objectives were to uncover usability and other technical issues within the red routes of the product. Two key questions to answer were: Is our prototype seamless and how do users navigate our product. The test tasks were as follows:</p>

It maintains a strong screen presence by guiding the users’ eyes directly to the information hotspots while simultaneously controlling the flow of information on the page.

            <p class="body-text">My first UX case study on the app "MIA" taught me the importance of preparation and iteration in the design process. Through thorough planning and multiple revisions, I was able to create a minimalistic and functional app that effectively uses signifiers and allows for future improvements in the user experience. One key takeaway was the importance of collecting quantitative research in future iterations to further optimize the design. Overall, I am satisfied with the final product and am confident that it serves its purpose and provides a pleasing user experience.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-header mt-64">Future Roadmap</h2>
            <ul>
              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Implement Quantitative Research:</strong> As mentioned in the conclusion, collecting quantitative research data is crucial for optimizing the design further. This can be achieved by conducting user testing sessions with a larger sample size and using analytics tools to track user behavior and interactions within the app. This data can be used to identify pain points and areas of improvement that were not apparent during the design process.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Address User Feedback:</strong> Feedback from users can be used to address any concerns or issues they may have with the app. Conducting surveys or feedback sessions can provide valuable insights on user preferences and expectations. This information can then be used to refine the design and improve the user experience further.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Incorporate New Features:</strong> As technology advances, it is important to stay up to date with the latest trends and innovations. Adding new features can keep the app relevant and engaging for users. However, it is important to carefully consider which features to include and how they will impact the overall user experience.</p>
              </li>
  
              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Evaluate App Performance:</strong> Regularly evaluating app performance can help identify any technical issues that may arise. This can be done by monitoring app crashes, response times, and other performance metrics. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain user satisfaction and prevent any negative impact on the app's reputation.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Continuously Iterate:</strong> Finally, it is important to remember that the design process is never truly finished. Continuously iterating and refining the app can help keep it relevant and competitive in the market. This can be done by using feedback, conducting research, and staying up to date with the latest design trends and technologies.
