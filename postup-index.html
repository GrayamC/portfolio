          <p class="body-text">PostUp actively sought feedback from remote workers and freelancers regarding their struggles with finding suitable public spaces for work. These professionals expressed a need for locations where they can settle in for a couple of hours between meetings or work from for an entire day. Furthermore, when visiting new areas of their city or traveling to unfamiliar destinations, users yearn for a dependable method to discover exceptional workspaces. The top attributes that users seek in these spaces include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Noise level:</strong> A quiet place to work, make phone calls and hold video chats with little background noise or crowds</p>

          </ul>
      
        <p class="body-text">PostUp will help users spend less time finding public places to work that has the basic amenities they need, and more time working. </p>

        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">Day 1 - Mapping</h1>
       
          <h2 class="sub-header">Think AirBNB for quiet workspaces</h2>
            <p class="body-text">On Day 1, I started to think about the PostUp’s benefits and the pain points it was solving. This app needs to address the primary needs of freelance, remote, and hybrid workers — finding a suitable public workspace in which to work. Ideally, the app will not only help speed the process of finding the best location but clearly illustrate the key amenities that are present in the location.

          <h2 class="sub-header mt-64">Sketching Process</h2>
          <p class="body-text">In order to draw inspiration from my user flows and incorporate key components into my own design, I utilized the Crazy 8's UX sketching technique. This technique involves rapidly sketching eight different design concepts in eight minutes, allowing for a wide range of ideas to be generated quickly. By utilizing this technique, I was able to brainstorm and explore different possibilities for my design without getting bogged down in the details. This approach helped me to identify key elements from each user flow that I could incorporate into my own design, such as easy access to saved locations and the ability to view a map with all nearby locations. By using the Crazy 8's technique, I was able to generate a variety of ideas and quickly identify the most promising concepts to incorporate into my design. This technique is particularly helpful in this situation as it allowed me to create a lot of different options to pick from, without spending too much time on any one design.

          <p class="body-text">I chose the final scene in the Crazy 8's sequence to be my critical screen for my 3 panel storyboard because it met all the criteria that I was looking for. It translated the best from paper to a live prototype, included different aspects from each lightning demo, and had the best overall UI/UX conversion. It was the best representation of my design vision and had the most potential for success as seen below.

            <h2 class="sub-header">Airbnb becomes my leading inspiration</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
              On the third day of my design process, I made the decision to heavily influence the design of PostUp by the user-centered and intuitive design system of the Airbnb app. However, I also recognized the value in incorporating key elements from other industry leaders such as Foursquare and Yelp, these include: 
            </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="case-list-item">
                  <strong> <p class="body-text">Foursquare's method of quantifying ratings</p></strong>

                  <li class="case-list-item">
                   <strong> <p class="body-text">Yelp's built-in map and navigation system to make the user experience more seamless.</p> </strong>

                     <strong><p class="body-text">Price-point metric from both Foursquare and Yelp, using a series of dollar signs ranging from "$" to "$$$" to indicate the cost of a listing. </p> </strong>
                  </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="body-text">
                    Overall, these decisions were made in order to create a more intuitive, user-friendly design that aligns with the needs and preferences of the target user group.
                  </p>

              
                </ul>

          <h1 class="main-header mt-192">Day 4 - Prototype</h1>
          <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">Verifying Assumptions through Effective Testing Strategires</h2>
          <p class="body-text">On Day 4, I developed the prototype for usability testing so I could evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the wireframe for the PostUp app brief. The prototype for this design is a low fidelity illustration of this process and was created by simply translating the wireframes into a more interactive format. </p>
            <div class="tasktable-holder">
          <img class="case-image hifi-main" src="./images/postup-prototype.png" data-aos="fade-left">

        <p class="body-text">The interactive prototype can be found <a  href="https://marvelapp.com/j597ec7" class="clickable">here</a></p>
        <p class="body-text mt-64">Testing focused on the user flow from opening the app and enabling location services to navigating to the desired destination. This was crucial in determining how intuitively users understood the purpose and options on each screen. The design of the app was heavily influenced by the user-intuitive and aesthetically pleasing design system of AirBnB, and it was important to understand if users were able to navigate the app with the same level of ease. The results of the usability testing provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the wireframe and informed necessary changes or adjustments before the final app was developed.”
        </p>

        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">05 - Testing</h1>
        <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">Does the PostUp prototype work?</h2>
        <p class="body-text">On Day 5, I commenced the usability testing process by interviewing five participants, four of whom were college students and one who is employed full time. Their ages ranged from 18 to 21, and they all fit the target demographic for the app. Scheduling was somewhat challenging due to the approaching holiday season, but I was able to conduct the interviews without too much difficulty.
          </p>

          <div class="tasktable-holder">
            <img class="case-image tasktable" src="./images/postup-hifi.png" data-aos="fade-left">
          </div>

          <p class="body-text">Overall, the interview process went smoothly. During the usability testing, most participants seemed to feel comfortable with the non-academic setting of the dormitory, however, some participants expressed concerns regarding the repeated nature of the interviews. To alleviate these concerns, I emphasized that the testing was solely focused on the app and not on their abilities as individuals, I also reassured them that there were no wrong answers and that their feedback was valuable for the improvement of the app. The testing provided valuable insights that I incorporated into a mid-fidelity wireframe, although it was not required by Springboard.</p>

          <div class="tasktable-holder mt-32">
            <img class="case-image tasktable" src="./images/postup-hifidemo.png" data-aos="fade-left">

              <p class="body-text result-text">
                Some users reported ambiguity after accepting location services, feeling uncertain about their next steps due to the lack of clear signifiers indicating the purpose of the screen and the intended navigation path. Moreover, many users attempted to interact with the search bar, but it did not function as expected. To address these issues, a more dynamic and interactive prototype should be developed, incorporating a functional search bar into the user flow and providing clear signifiers and instructions on the screen. User testing on the interactive prototype can provide valuable feedback to improve the app before its final release.

              In conclusion, my case study on Blink Bikes e-commerce website design highlights the significance of an iterative and user-centered approach in creating a successful user experience. By conducting thorough user research, including surveys, user interviews, and usability testing, we gain valuable insights into the needs and pain points of our target audience: high-income earners looking to purchase premium bikes. These insights inform the design decisions and help create a visually appealing and intuitive website that meets user needs while aligning with business goals.</p>

              The use of interactive wireframes and prototypes facilitates stakeholder buy-in and ensures that design decisions are made in a collaborative environment. Iterative design allows for feedback from users, leading to improvements in the user experience, such as optimizing the checkout process and integrating a comprehensive bike comparison tool.

                Furthermore, the website's design emphasizes the use of high-quality visuals and clear product information, conveying the quality of the bikes and creating an aspirational feel that resonates with the target audience. The use of persuasive design techniques, such as social proof and scarcity, helps encourage conversions and drive sales.
