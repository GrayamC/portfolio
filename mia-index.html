        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">Goal</h1>
        <p class="body-text">With young adults, age 16-29 as the primary audience, the goal was to help young adults who struggle to keep track of their budget better manage their money. I did this by designining a mobile-first app that focused on their primary concern — budgeting. With a user-friendly interface that promotes quick interaction, relevant and actionable notifications, and bite size educational tips, MIA will help users build confidence while holding themselves accountable for their personal finances. </p>
        
        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">01 - Discovery</h1>
        
          <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">What are competitors doing?</h2>
          <p class="body-text">I started by researching three existing apps that target young adults and performed a heuristic analysis rating them 1-5 against four criteria, with 5 being the highest.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Match between system and real world:</strong> Does the product help the user with their most fundamental problem — budgeting in real life?</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>User control and freedom:</strong> Does the product enable enough flexibility for the user to feel like it’s custom-made for them?</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</strong> Does the product actively demonstrate the simplicity it desires for the user?</p>
            </li>

            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</strong> Is the product designed in a way that attracts the user to engage around the product mission?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
 
        <p class="body-text">All three featured colorways that were minimalist and aesthetically uncluttered, but each struggled with usability with regard to content and signup. YNAB’s language most focused on budgeting, but it was a surprisingly lackluster and frustratingly unrefined tool for managing real-world finances. Pocketguard succeeds in simplicity but falls short in usability and freedom since it often feels cluttered and hard to navigate. Mint succeeded in creating an easy to use budgeting tool. While they fall short in some aspects of user control at signup and transparency with a beginner audience, especially when delving into deeper financial topics; they make up for it with a sleek design that is user friendly and easy to navigate.</p>

By analyzing the data and observing user behavior, I was able to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

              <p class="body-text mt-32"><strong>With freedom comes great responsibility:</strong> Young adults understand that they have to keep track of what they spend, grow their savings and earn passive income along the way. While they may make mental notes about their spending and open bank or investment accounts, they are prone to making regretful impulse purchases, which is exasperated by balancing work, school and their social life.</p>
  
              <p class="body-text mt-64"><strong>Confidence and understanding breeds responsibility:</strong> Young adults want to be independent and generate their own income to pay their bills and purchase the things they want. However, they are anxious about their newfound freedom and what this level of independence truly means. They seek ways to build their financial literacy that fit into their lifestyle so they can more accurately track spending, budget for the long-term and grow their savings so they can become more economically sound.</p>

The goal was to determine product quality and seamlessness of the experience to promote adoption and repeat usage.

            <p class="body-text">My first UX case study on the app "MIA" taught me the importance of preparation and iteration in the design process. Through thorough planning and multiple revisions, I was able to create a minimalistic and functional app that effectively uses signifiers and allows for future improvements in the user experience. One key takeaway was the importance of collecting quantitative research in future iterations to further optimize the design. Overall, I am satisfied with the final product and am confident that it serves its purpose and provides a pleasing user experience.</p>

              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Implement Quantitative Research:</strong> As mentioned in the conclusion, collecting quantitative research data is crucial for optimizing the design further. This can be achieved by conducting user testing sessions with a larger sample size and using analytics tools to track user behavior and interactions within the app. This data can be used to identify pain points and areas of improvement that were not apparent during the design process.</p>

              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Address User Feedback:</strong> Feedback from users can be used to address any concerns or issues they may have with the app. Conducting surveys or feedback sessions can provide valuable insights on user preferences and expectations. This information can then be used to refine the design and improve the user experience further.</p>

              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Incorporate New Features:</strong> As technology advances, it is important to stay up to date with the latest trends and innovations. Adding new features can keep the app relevant and engaging for users. However, it is important to carefully consider which features to include and how they will impact the overall user experience.</p>
              </li>
  
              <li class="case-list-item">
                <p class="body-text"><strong>Evaluate App Performance:</strong> Regularly evaluating app performance can help identify any technical issues that may arise. This can be done by monitoring app crashes, response times, and other performance metrics. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain user satisfaction and prevent any negative impact on the app's reputation.
