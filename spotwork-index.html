        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">Goal</h1>
        
          <p class="body-text">In order to expand their customer base and broaden their market, Spotwork asked our group to build a high-fidelity prototype based on their current website, which is not yet perfect, to demonstrate the functionality of their product for the purpose of onboarding potential employers to their platform.</p>
          
        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">01 - Background</h1>
       
            <p class="body-text">To build a standout product, it is essential to understand the competitive landscape and identify industry best practices as well as where our product falls within that landscape. We conducted competitive analysis against Spotwork’s top competitors, including not but limited to: Wonolo, UpShift, and Thumbtack to understand how others tackled problems that may have arose during our design process. 
            </p>
    
          <p class="body-text">
            We collaborated with a diverse and cross-functional team to get up to speed with Spotwork’s current design language. This involved familiarizing ourselves with Spotwork's brand identity, by immersing ourselves in all their platforms from employer, employee, and developer perspectives via special access to their developer tools. Additionally, it’s important that we understood the structure and use cases of their visual elements by repeated use and reconstruction of fully functional pages and components. By aligning with the established design language, we ensured consistency across the platform, reinforcing Spotwork's brand and making the demo an authentic representation of the live service.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            The fruition of our research and collaboration efforts allowed us to lay a strong foundation for the development of a demo that effectively highlights Spotwork's competitive edge in the crowded on-demand staffing market.
          </p>
        
          
          <h1 class="main-header mt-192">02 - User Testing</h1>
          
            <p class="body-text">
              As a crucial part of the project, our team conducted comprehensive user testing to identify areas for improvement in the demo. This process involved in-person interviews and applying UX testing methodologies, such as usability testing and task analysis, to gather valuable insights into user behavior and preferences. Following the tests, we compiled our findings into an affinity map to discern patterns, pain points, and areas requiring further refinement.
            </p>

            <div class="tasktable-holder">
              <img class="tasktable" src="./images/spotwork-affinity.jpg" data-aos="fade-left">
            </div>

            <p class="body-text">
              In summary, two key findings emerged from the user testing: participants experienced difficulties completing the "Create Position" and "Post a Shift'' user flows. To address these issues, we proposed increasing the weight and visibility of the Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons for these flows, making it more intuitive for users to navigate and complete the tasks. By implementing these changes, we aimed to enhance the user experience and ensure the demo accurately represents the efficiency and ease-of-use that Spotwork's live service offers to its clients.
            </p>
            
          <h1 class="main-header mt-192">03 - Analysis</h1>
            <p class="body-text">
              To ensure our demo effectively showcases the key features and functions of Spotwork's live service, we decided to map out the entire platform in its current state. With information architecture laid out and easily interpretable, we were able to holistically create a comprehensive site map and detailed maps of core user flows. 
            </p>

                <div class="tasktable-holder">
                  <img class="case-image tasktable" src="./images/spotwork-map1.png" data-aos="fade-left">
                </div>

                <div class="tasktable-holder">
                  <img class="case-image tasktable" src="./images/spotwork-map2.png" data-aos="fade-left">
                </div>

                <div class="tasktable-holder">
                  <img class="case-image tasktable" src="./images/spotwork-map3.png" data-aos="fade-left">
                </div>

                <p class="body-text">
                  These maps served as essential tools for our team in multiple ways. First, they helped us identify the most important aspects of the live service to be highlighted in the demo, ensuring a comprehensive representation of Spotwork's capabilities. Second, the maps enabled us to detect any potential bottlenecks or redundancies in the existing user flows, allowing us to optimize the demo's design for an enhanced user experience.                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                  In addition to the immediate benefits for the demo, these maps will also prove invaluable for the future development of the Spotwork app. They provide a solid foundation for iterating on the platform's fundamental design, enabling the team to make informed decisions when implementing new features, optimizing existing flows, or refining the platform's overall structure. By meticulously mapping the platform, our team has not only ensured a successful demo but also laid the groundwork for Spotwork's continued growth and innovation.

          <h1 class="main-header mt-192">04 - Prototyping</h1>
          <p class="body-text">With valuable insights from user testing in hand, our team moved forward to create a high fidelity prototype that accurately represents the look and feel of the final product. To work efficiently and maximize our collective skills, we coordinated the division of labor by assigning specific tasks to team members.          </p>
            <div class="tasktable-holder">
          <img class="case-image hifi-main" src="./images/spotwork-prototype.png" data-aos="fade-left">

        <p class="body-text mt-64">Effective communication played a crucial role in our success, ensuring that we stayed on the
          same page throughout the process. We established regular check-ins, progress updates, and feedback sessions to maintain a cohesive and collaborative environment. This approach enabled us to address any challenges promptly, iterate on our designs, and refine the user experience.          
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">Figma served as our primary platform for building <a class="clickable" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/clDIgBN3ly9V8bx8UqKpXX/Spotwork?type=design&node-id=12-3649&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=12%3A2143&starting-point-node-id=12%3A3649">the high fidelity prototype</a>, providing a collaborative and easy-to-use interface that facilitated seamless teamwork. By harnessing the power of Figma, we were able to create, iterate, and share our designs effortlessly, leading to a final prototype that showcases the full potential of Spotwork's live service for employers.</p>
