The goal is to increase the customer conversion rate by improving the shopping to checkout process by offering an exclusive e-commerce platform that provides a seamless shopping experience. The website is designed to cater to the needs of its target audience, 24-38 year old high income earners. with a user-friendly interface that promotes intuitive navigation, secure and quick payment options, exclusive discounts, and the ability to compare and contrast products.

        <h1 class="main-header mt-192">01 - Discovery</h1>
          <h2 class="sub-header mt-32">What are competitors doing?</h2>
          <p class="body-text">I started by researching three existing platforms that serve a similar purpose and performed a heuristic analysis compiling a list of likes, dislikes, and actionable items for each, then creating a list of 5 overall actionable items to implement into the design and research of Blink Bikes. </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Information availability:</strong> Increase the amount of detailed product information available on the website to help users make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Ease of access and navigation:</strong> Review and reorganize the information architecture of the website to make it clearer and more intuitive for users.</p>
            </li>
  
            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Ideate - Test - Validate:</strong> Conduct user testing and gather feedback to identify other areas of improvement for the cart to checkout user flow.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Maintenance and upkeep:</strong> Implement changes based on user feedback to improve the overall user experience and monitor the website's performance to ensure a smooth and efficient user flow</p>
            </li>

            <li class="case-list-item">
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Website load and efficiency:</strong> Optimize the website's loading times to reduce wait time for users and bounce rates.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
    
        <p class="body-text">Amazon's checkout process is often cited as a gold standard in e-commerce, thanks to its simple and straightforward layout that makes it easy for users to navigate and understand. The flow is flexible and convenient, allowing users to perform any action, such as editing their cart or viewing their order summary, from any screen. The user flow is designed with minimal clutter and distraction, with each step clearly labeled and easy to complete, resulting in a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.</p>
        <p class="body-text">TrekBikes has a visually pleasing UI with a modern aesthetic that showcases their products well. However, the cart-to-checkout process is confusing and frustrating due to its poorly structured information architecture, lack of clear guidance, and poor organization. This makes it difficult for users to understand where and when to click on individual elements. In contrast, Target's cart-to-checkout user flow is user-friendly, straightforward, and efficient, with a simple UI that guides the user effectively, similar to Amazon's user flow.</p>

          <p class="body-text">
            Using a combination of subject interviews and empathy mapping, I crafted the following persona.

          <p class="body-text">To improve the user experience and increase cart conversion rates on an e-commerce website, create a cohesive brand image, prioritize website speed and functionality, and offer convenient payment options. The website should be visually pleasing and showcase products well, while also having a user-friendly interface that promotes intuitive navigation. Clutter and distraction should be minimized, and each step in the process should be clearly labeled and easy to complete. By focusing on these factors, companies can create an inviting and intuitive shopping experience for potential consumers, ultimately increasing cart conversion rates and driving repeat sales.</p>

              <p class="body-text">Two rounds of usability tests were conducted, one low fidelity and one high fidelity. The intended test demographic was originally meant to be conducted on users between the ages of 24 - 38, majority men, high-income earners. Unfortunately, I didn’t and still don’t have immediate access to anyone who fits this criteria. I, instead, tested close friends of family, some of whom are actively in the bicycle market and some not. Regardless, these tests provided valuable insight into the overall usability and intuitiveness of the platform.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The goal was to determine product quality and seamlessness of the experience to promote adoption and repeat usage. The test objectives were to uncover usability and other technical issues within the red routes of the product. Two key questions to answer were: Is our prototype seamless and how do users navigate our product? The test tasks were as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="case-list-item">
                  <p class="body-text"> <strong>Task 1:</strong> Add two bikes, the Z100  Mountain and the Royal Iron 315Z to the cart

            <p class="body-text"> One major issue was that users frequently found the "Browse" button confusing, not knowing its purpose. To address this, I made the button more descriptive by changing its wording to "Browse Bikes" or simply removing the button altogether. Another issue was that users were confused by the comparison feature, which would automatically compare two bikes as soon as they were added to the cart. To improve this, I added a "Compare" button next to each bike on the details page and included a confirmation message when the user selected the "compare" button. Finally, the checkout process was unclear for some users, particularly the order of operations. To address this issue, I added more visual cues and instructions to guide users through the checkout process, making it more intuitive and straightforward.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Overall, by implementing these solutions, I was able to significantly improve the website's usability and provide a better user experience.</p>

           <h2 class="sub-header mt-64">High Fidelity Usability Test Results</h2>
            <p class="body-text">One issue was that users often had trouble discerning if there was an item in their cart as there was no visual cue, and the cart would also scroll out of screen. To address this issue, I incorporated a "View Cart" button on the homepage and put the cart in the navigation bar, making it more visible and easily accessible. Another issue was that users had trouble comparing two items because the "Compare" button in the navigation wasn't functional. To address this issue, I ensured that "Compare" was fully functional and incorporated a side-by-side function, making it easier for users to compare two items. Finally, users had trouble figuring out how to sign in because the profile button wasn't functional. To address this issue, I ensured that the profile icon was functional and allowed for sign-in, and I added a sign-in option on the account page, making it easier for users to access their account and sign in. </p>
            <p class="body-text">Overall, by addressing these issues, I was able to significantly improve the user experience of the website and ensure that users were able to easily navigate and use the site's features.</p>

          <h1 class="main-header mt-192">04 - The Final Product</h1>
          <p class="body-text">I designed Blink Bikes to feel active, simplistic and intuitive to use. Simplicity is its central asset. It maintains a strong screen presence by guiding the users’ eyes directly to the information hotspots while simultaneously controlling the flow of information on the page. Users meet little to no resistance at every point of interaction and can efficiently use the information available to make an informed decision on what bike will suit their needs best. </p>
